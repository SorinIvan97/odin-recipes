    <div class="description"><h2>Description of the recipe</h2></div>

    <p> <em>French fries</em> (North American English), chips (British English and other national varieties), finger chips (Indian English), french-fried potatoes, or simply fries, are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin from Belgium or France.</p>
    <p>They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer. Pre-cut, blanched, and frozen russet potatoes are widely used, and sometimes baked in a regular or convection oven; air fryers are small convection ovens marketed for frying potatoes.</p>
    <p>French fries are served hot, either soft or crispy, and are generally eaten as part of lunch or dinner or by themselves as a snack, and they commonly appear on the menus of diners, fast food restaurants, pubs, and bars. They are often salted and may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialities. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine or chili cheese fries. French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes. A baked variant, oven fries, uses less or no oil.</p>
    <p><strong>I really like french fries!</strong></p>

    <div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3></div>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg floury potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking salt / kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 litre vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="steps"><h2>Steps</h2></div>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut: Peel the potatoes. Cut into 6 mm French fries using a serrated knife.</li>
        <li>Keep cut fries submerged in a bowl of water to prevent them from going brown while you cut the remainder. (No need for actual soaking beyond this.)</li>
        <li>Rinse: Transfer potatoes to a colander and rinse under tap water for 15 – 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Place fries in a large pot with 2 litres/quarts of cold tap water, vinegar and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat then immediately reduce stove to low so the surface is rippling gently, not big bubbles. Cook for 10 minutes then carefully remove using a slotted spoon into a colander (do not tip into colander, fries will break).</li>
        <li>Dry 5 min: Spread the fries on 2 tea towel lined trays. Leave to steam dry for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pot: Pour 3 cm / 1.2" of oil in a pot that is at least 10cm/4" high (for safety, need at least 7 cm from oil surface to rim of pot</li>
        <li>Separate the fries into 3 Batches (for cooking)</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 205°C over medium high heat</li>
        <li>10 sec pause: Lower 1/3 of Batch 1 fries into the oil using a slotted spoon. WAIT 10 seconds, add another 1/3 of the fries, wait 10 seconds, then add the remaining Batch 1 fries.</li>
        <li>50 sec fry: Fry for 50 seconds, moving them around once or twice. Then remove with a slotted spoon onto 2 paper towel lined trays, spread out in a single layer. The fries will still be white and floppy.</li>
        <li>Repeat with Batches 2 and 3, ensuring the oil is back at 205°C before cooking.</li>
        <li>30 min cool: Leaves fries to cool for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Line a large bowl with paper towels – for draining and tossing.</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 205°C. Fry half the French fries for 4 minutes, moving them around twice, or until golden brown and crispy. Drain in the lined bowl, then repeat with remaining fries.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle fries with salt or seasoning or choice.</li>
    </ol>
