    <h2>Description of the recipe</h2>

    <p><strong>Banana bread</strong> is a type of sweet bread made from mashed bananas. It is often a <em>moist</em> and <em>sweet</em> quick bread but some recipes are yeast raised.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 ⅓ cups mashed overripe bananas</li>        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175 degrees C. Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until just combined. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
